Hello and thanks for opening an issue!

If you're not sure, you can use this repository that has been prepared with a bare-bones Laravel application and tests running on a CI environment: [https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/laravel-dusk-mocking-sandbox](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/laravel-dusk-mocking-sandbox).
